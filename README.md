Ultimately, this will be a monster generator for use in tabletop roleplaying games.  It will be supported on desktop and mobile browsers.
Initially, this will support the game system I am running at the moment.  Namely, [Mothership](http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/mothership).  The idea is to quickly generate a monster that the party has never seen in order to circumvent inherent metagaming in tabletop roleplaying.  
Primary goals:
Can be used with two button presses, at the table, during play
Stats for Mothership, but descriptions general enough to extrapolate stats from for other (mostly osr) systems
Basic interface for use on mobile and pc

Future goals:
Saving of monster blocks (perhaps an account system is required)
Additional systems supported with explicit stats
Ability to fine-tune requirements (desert/sea/oxygen-less creature?) and attribute ranges
